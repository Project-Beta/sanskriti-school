            <p>Learning Centre comprises Junior LC( Classes Nursery to VI) and Senior LC( Classes VII- XII) .Learning Centre has been an integral part of the school since the school’s inception in 1998. It focuses on a holistic curriculum which not only
              addresses concerns related to academics, socio – emotional , physio – motor , speech and linguistic area but also in developing pre- vocational skills of the child to keep pace with the formal system of education. A team of professionals
              devises the same, suiting the child’s needs and ability to absorb and apply the information meted out to him/her. The junior and senior school learning centres persevere continuously so as to allow these gifted children to overcome challenges.
              Along with guiding them in their academics, they are also groomed in another quintessential aspect, which is imbibing the values of a good Sanskritian, and in turn a good samaritian. This combination allows them to simultaneously excel in
              academics and co-curricular fields, which render them capable of fulfilling their goals. </p>
            <p>The centre provides training mainly through three mediums: </p>
            <div class="ul">
